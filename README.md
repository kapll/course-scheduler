# course-scheduler
Java-based mock course scheduler intended to replicate a university's course tracking system.

Developed using topics I had learned in my Java class, including object oriented programming concepts like class inheritance and extension, data structures like tree maps, and Java interfaces like comparable and compareto.

This is merely a small-scale project, not meant to be used in a professional capacity.<br>
